Study implementations, specifications, and applications of 4 classes of distributed algorithms and frameworks:
(1) Distributed consensus,
(2) Distributed storage,
(3) Security protocols, and
(4) Distributed programming support.

For each of the 4 classes, you are asked to find 3 best implementations or specifications and 1 best use/application that you can find---specifically,

1. Describe how and where you looked for these, what you found, and why the ones you selected as best are the best in your opinion.

For example, you may say that you googled "Paxos implementation" and found 8 implementations (list them), and you chose the 1st because it has the best documentation and is easy to run, the 4th because it has the most features, and the 8th because it is the most efficient (based on what you've tried or read).

2. For each of the 3 best implementations or specifications that you selected, collect values for all items listed in the form below and enter them into the form:

3. For the use/application that you find, (1) collect values for all items listed in the form above, or indicate that they are the same as one of 3 implementations or specifications you selected, and (2) describe how the application uses the particular algorithm implementation or specification.

Note: 

For each implementation, specification, or application you find, give its source; use the Wikipedia format for citing source:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources
Remember to include at least author, title, source, and date.

Extra credits:

You may report additional best implementations, specifications, and applications, if for some of the classes, you find more than three that are equally best.

You will need to justify why they are equally good.
